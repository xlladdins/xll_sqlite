# xll_sqlite

Use [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) from Excel. Think of it as the 
[`sqlite3`](https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html#getting_started) command line shell on steroids.

## Usage

Clone [xll_sqlite](https://github.com/xlladdins/xll_sqlite) in Visual Studio 2022,
open `xll_sqlite.sln` and press `F5` to build and open Excel with the add-in loaded.

Open or create a sqlite database using `=\SQL.DB(file, options)`.
If no arguments are specified a temporary in-memory database is created.
[`SQLITE_OPEN_XXX()`](https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/c_open_autoproxy.html) 
enumerations are provided for `options`. Add them to get the mask you want.

Get the big picture with [`=SQL.SCHEMA(db)`](https://www.sqlite.org/schematab.html).
The common pragmas [`=SQL.TABLE_LIST(db)`](https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_table_list)
and [`=SQL.TABLE_INFO(db, name)`](https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_table_info)
are provided in addition to [`=SQL.PRAGMA(db, pragma)`](https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html)
that calls `PRAGMA pragma`.

Call [`=SQL.QUERY(db, sql)`](https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/query.html) to return
the result of executing `sql`. 

You can create a sqlite statement with `=SQL.STMT(db)`
and use the result as the first argument to 
[`=SQL.PREPARE(stmt, sql)`](https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/prepare.html).
Bind parameter values with [`=SQL.BIND(stmd, range)`](https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/bind_blob.html)
where `range` is one-dimensional to specify positional parameters or a two column
range of key-value pairs to bind based on the key name. The binding type is
based on each value's Excel type.
Statements are executed with [`=SQL.EXEC(stmt)`](https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/exec.html).

Sqlite tables are created using 
[`=SQL.CREATE_TABLE(db, name, data, columns, types)`](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html).
The the `columns` and `types` are used for the schema in `CREATE TABLE` and `data`
are `INSERT INTO` to the table. If `data` is missing then the table is created.

If `columns` are not specified then the first row of `data` is used for column names. 
The allowed `_types` are those specified
in the [Affinity Name Examples](https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#affinity_name_examples).

If `types` are not specified the data is inspected to guess the type.

If table `name` exists it is dropped before being recreated.

It is also possible to create tables from a query using 
[`=SQL.CREATE_TABLE_AS(db, name, stmt)`](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html).
The new table will contain the result of executing the statement.

## FAQ

<dl>

<dt>Do I have to to the sweep out ranges, F2, Ctrl-Shift-Enter, rinse and repeat, 
then press Ctrl-Z when I see `#VALUE!`s to get the actual output of range-valued functions?</dt>
<dd>Not if you use a modern version of Excel with 
<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/excel-blog/preview-of-dynamic-arrays-in-excel/ba-p/252944">
dynamic arrays</a>
</dd>

<dt>What are those funny numbers coming out of commands that start with a backslash (`\`)?</dt>
<dd>They are  64-bit
floating point C++ doubles with the same bits as the address in memory of the underlying C++ object.
See <a href="https://github.com/xlladdins/xll#handle">handles</a>
</dd>

<dt>My SQL queries are too big to put in one cell.</dt>
<dd>You can spread the query over a range of cells. The values are concatenated
using a space character before being sent to sqlite.</dd>

<dt>Why is it so fast?</dt>
<dd>Because it uses
<a href="https://github.com/xlladdins/xll_sqlite/blob/master/win_mem_view.h">memory mapped</a>
files. Things will break when you try to return over 8GB of data.</dd>

<dt>How did you create this add-in?</dt>
<dd>Using my <a href="https://github.com/xlladdins/xll">xll</a> library.
You can use it to embed C++ (or C, or Fortran, ...) in Excel.
